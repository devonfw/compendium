<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Functional Analysts and Designers in the Yard are responsible for the high-level, functional design of a software system. This defines its functionality based on the defined Business requirements. They assure that each modular part of a device has only one responsibility and performs that responsibility with the minimum of side effects on other parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Important tasks of the functional designers is to guard against over specifying the design as well as scope creep. The former can be prevented by using Agile methodologies like user stories and capturing requirements in a series of automated acceptance tests (BDD). Scope creep can be avoided by utilizing Requirements management techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using methodologies like Domain Driven Design (DDD) or Model Driven Architecture (MDA) the designers model the system with the principal aim to  separate design from architecture. The functional design addresses the functional requirements while architecture provides the infrastructure through which non-functional requirements like scalability, reliability and performance are realized.</p>

<p>Domain-driven design: A methodology and process prescription for the development of complex systems whose focus is mapping activities, tasks, events, and data within a problem domain into the technology artefacts of a solution domain.</p>

<li>
<p>Model-driven architecture: MDA is a software design approach for the development of software systems. It provides a set of guidelines for the structuring of specifications, which are expressed as models. Model-driven architecture supports model-driven engineering of software systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creation of User Stories: A central development artefact for Agile project teams. A user story is a very high-level definition of a requirement, containing just enough information so that the developers can produce a reasonable estimate of the effort to implement it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Case definition: A Use cases  a set of interactions between a system and one or more actors, with actors being people, other systems, or both. It describes not only a behaviour, but also how that behaviour can be achieved.</p>

<p>The Yard contains the role of the Solution Architect. His/her role is to focus on the Software architecture of the solution. This refers to the high level structures of a software system, the discipline of creating such structures, and the documentation of these structures. These structures are needed to reason about the software system. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.</p>

<p>The role of the Software architect is critical. A solid architecture can reduce the cost of development in the long run, ensuring quality and scalability of the system.</p>

<p>Architectural Synthesis: The process of creating an architecture. Given the architecturally significant requirements determined by the analysis, the current state of the design and the results of any evaluation activities, the design is created and improved</p>

<li>
<p>Architecture Evaluation: The process of determining how well the current design or a portion of it satisfies the requirements derived during analysis. Validate the correctness of a proposed solution, support its implementation and assess possible shortcomings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architecture Evolution: The process of maintaining and adapting an existing software architecture to meet requirement and environmental changes. It is concerned with adding new functionality as well as maintaining existing functionality and system behaviour.</p>
