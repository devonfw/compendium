For the definition of the programming interfaces have been developed for both the inputs and the outputs.  Thus, when adding new features is much easier, since we only have to implement the necessary classes and the interface.  On the other hand, tests have been carried out, which verify that the operation of the code is correct and in case of failure we quickly know where our problem lies. At final, we can see a scheme to know what is the operation depending on the input or output parameters.
